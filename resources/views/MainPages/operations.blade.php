<br />

<h5>Support for in-house IT teams</h5>

<p>We are here to support in-house IT teams with a range of specialist services.

<br />

<p>We're experienced in planning and executing office moves, whether they be internal reorganisations or full office relocations. Our seamless project management of your move offers value engineered design, making sure your data is protected during the move, preparing your new premises with sufficient communication requirments and full testing of your new network.</p>

<br />

<h5>Backup & DR (Disaster Recovery)</h5>
<p>Backups should be carried out on a daily basis, especially in today's cyber climate. They are useful for immediate access to a document which needs restoring. They are not a substitute for a DR (Disaster Recovery) Plan.</p>

<p>A DR Plan should be a part of every business' strategy, to determine the maximum amount of time it can be without its IT systems if disaster was to strike. </p>
