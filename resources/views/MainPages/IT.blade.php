<h5>ITSM (IT Service Management) includes the processes and technology used to plan, deliver, and support IT services.</h5>

<p>Automated process workflow improves collaboration and eliminates many manual tasks. ITSM reduces and streamlines many employee tasks, giving them more time to focus on strategy and customers.</p>

<p>Information technologies now encompass and incorporate tasks and responsibilities from across the entire organization. Managing these services is an ongoing challenge, and customers expect businesses to be up to the task. Businesses depend on ITSM to effectively coordinate these nearly countless tasks and processes, while ensuring that they are providing real value to the customer.</p>

<p>Technology is an integral part of IT processes, but it should not necessarily be the primary focus. ITSM is more encompassing, expanding to include business objectives in addition to traditional IT objectives. As a result, IT service management improves efficiencies across the board.</p>
